    "Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.\n",
    "A1. In Python, there are some conventions that are commonly followed when declaring variables. Here are some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variable names should be descriptive: Variable names should reflect the purpose of the variable, so it's clear what data it represents. For example, use name instead of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use lowercase letters: In Python, it's common to use all lowercase letters for variable names. For example, my_variable instead of My_Variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use underscores to separate words: If a variable name consists of multiple words, use underscores to separate them. For example, my_variable_name instead of myvariablename.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Avoid using reserved words: Don't use Python's reserved words for variable names. For example, if, else, for, while, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use camel case for class names: If you're defining a class, use camel case to separate words. For example, MyClass instead of my_class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use all caps for constants: If you're defining a constant value, use all caps. For example, MAX_SIZE instead of max_size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Be consistent: Whatever conventions you choose to follow, be consistent throughout your code."
