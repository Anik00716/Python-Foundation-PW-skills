What is a tuple in Python?\n\nA1. In Python, a tuple is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list. However, tuples are immutable, which means they cannot be modified once they are created.\n\nQ2. How do you create a tuple in Python?\n\nA2. To create a tuple in Python, we can enclose a sequence of elements in parentheses () or use the tuple() function.\n\nQ3. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?\n\nA3. The main difference between a tuple and a list in Python is that tuples are immutable while lists are mutable. This means that we can change the elements of a list, but we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is created. Additionally, lists are represented using square brackets [], while tuples are represented using parentheses ().\n\nQ4. Can a tuple be changed in Python?\n\nA4. No, a tuple cannot be changed in Python. Once a tuple is created, you cannot add, remove or modify its elements.\n\nQ5. How do you access elements in a tuple?\n\nA5. we can access elements in a tuple using indexing, just like we would with a list. Indexing in Python starts from 0.\n\nQ6. How do you unpack a tuple in Python?\n\nA6. To unpack a tuple in Python, we can assign its elements to multiple variables at once. The number of variables must match the number of elements in the tuple.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}}]}
